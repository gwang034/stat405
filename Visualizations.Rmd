```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## Read in dataset
```{r}
library(readr)
tx_houston <- read_csv("/Users/virginiabaskin/Downloads/tx_houston_2023_01_26.csv")
head(tx_houston)
```

### Created smaller dataset to work with initially.

Our computers were struggling to work with the entire dataset, so we created a mini dataset by randomly sampling 1,000 rows. We will use this dataset for creating the graphs/brainstorming, then we will run the code on the large dataset as a final step. 
```{r}
mini_htx <- read_csv("Datasets/mini_htx.csv")
mini_htx
```

```{r}

```
